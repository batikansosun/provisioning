With a slick yet powerful interface with advanced search options, this application will put you in the driver’s seat to manage provisioning profiles.

With Provisioning Profile Manager, you can manage installed provisioning profiles from your Mac and identify expired, corrupted, or otherwise unavailable entries.

Learn everything you need to know about a specific provisioning profile expiration date, certificates, whitelisted UDIDs, and more.

Due to popular demand, Managing Profile Provisioning now allows you to compare two or more profiles - stop guessing and quickly identify missing UDIDs, certificates, or authorizations.

Filter and group profiles by platform, team, or validity.

IMPORTANT! when you first launch the app you must select “provisioning profile” directory from Open File Dialog Window. That will be open automatically and one-time.

## Requirements
MacOS 10.13+
